# BirthdayCountdown

 As I'm starting to learn Javascript and I wanted to make my acquired knowledge ( which is just a little bit now ) to practive and wanted to make a countdown timer to my Birthday.
 The code was mainly extracted from "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp" with a bit of changes to make it work fine with my HTML document.
 It is not that original of idea but after understanding this code I got to learn many things and make it to practice hoping to start making these codes alone after getting more familiar with the language.
